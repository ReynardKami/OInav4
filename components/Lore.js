              Ō-Inari, the patron of prosperity, harvests, and smithing. Brought
              into existence by The Everlasting Ruler. Ō-Inari, with their fox
              familiar at their side, governed over humans and their quest for
              abundance. Growing weary of the duty and the increasing number of
              humans, Ō-Inari handed this task to select Kami (Supernatural
              Entities) from the multiverse and assigned them a familiar. Being
              master shapeshifters they took on many forms, neither being good
              nor evil but just "being". The 3333 select Kami under Ō-Inari's
              command foolishly grew drunk on power, looking down on humans as
              lowly, and neglecting their duty to assist them. The Everlasting
              Ruler in his wrath was VERY displeased. He stripped the Kami of
              their powers and scattered them across the multiverse to 300 years
              of servitude as "lowly humans". As for the familiar, The
              Everlasting Ruler was merciful enough to leave these adorable
              familiars in the hands mankind to use as they see fit, as humans
              lack the supernatural powers to greatly abuse this blessing. On
              the return of the Kami they will be bound to each familiar bonded
              with each human as a lesson from The Everlasting Ruler for them to
              know their place.
